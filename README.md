# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is my version of The Odin Project Foundation course third project and first JavaScript project. It allows the user to play rock paper scissors against the computer. The user is asked to input one of these three fields (case-insensitive) and the computer then outputs a randomised outcome.

This project was built to learn more about JS functions and specifically DOM manipulation.

### Rules
The rules are simple - this is a Best of 5 game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. It's a pure game of chance. In case both player and computer select the same option, it's a tie and no points are assigned.
