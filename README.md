# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is my version of The Odin Project Foundation course third project and first JavaScript project. It allows the user to play rock paper scissors against the computer. The user is asked to input one of these three fields (case-insensitive) and the computer then outputs a randomised outcome.

Initially, no front end is created and the console should be used to play.
